# Mask-Detection-Python

In this repository, I have created a machine learning model which will detect in real time that you're wearing the mask or not
Just clone this repository using <code>https://github.com/Himesh-29/Mask-Detection-Python.git</code>, open jupter notebook and just run all the cells.

### Note: Install the required python package using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
